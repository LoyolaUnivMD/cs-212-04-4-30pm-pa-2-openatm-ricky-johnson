What is the most challenging thing you experienced?
     Classes and OOP. The more I use them, the more confused I get. This will likely be my answer to this question
     for a while.

How did you overcome it?
    I did not. I no longer have time to work on this assignment. If I wait any longer to submit, the late penalty applied
    to a fully functioning program would likely net me a similar score to what I am submitting now. I have other assignments
    I need to work on. Hopefully, I will have time to come back to this one and understand my mistakes.

Anything you would do differently given what you know now.
    No idea. I did not learn much from this assignment.

Was it helpful to build on a project that you already built in lab?
    In this case, no. When I first started this assignment, I thought it would be helpful. However, adding to the previous
    version of this project has created a program that is too large for me to comprehend at my current understanding of
    classes and OOP.

Are you becoming more comfortable with classes?
    I do not think so. I feel my knowledge of them at best is the same. At worst, my understanding of classes and
    programming logic is regressing. I feel that my ability to create a logical design and program is worse than it was
    by the end of CS151 last semester.

How did you feel about arrays? Were there things about them that you would like to overcome?
    I am not a fan of arrays right now. From my current understanding of arrays and array lists, it seems that array lists
    are more useful. Arrays feel limited in their use. The inability to append values is also annoying. However, we only
    briefly talked about array lists in class. So, I do not know enough information about them to know my true opinion.
